        <ul>
            <li>Warm water</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Garlic Butter Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Briefly stir together the warm water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and give it a quick stir, then let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is foamy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, yogurt, salt, baking powder, and egg.  Using the dough attachment, mix the dough on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from the mixing bowl and use your hands to shape it into a ball.  Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is ready to go, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into an even(ish) circle.  Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands.  Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>  Add a piece of the rolled-out dough to the pan and cook for 1 minute, or until the top of the dough begins to bubble and the bottom turns lightly golden.  Flip the dough and cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate.</li>
